Fish Species Classification with ANN
This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify different species of fish using image data. The dataset contains fish images in multiple categories, and the model has been trained using data augmentation techniques for better generalization.

Key Features:
Model: ANN with several hidden layers, ReLU activation, dropout layers, and softmax for classification.
Data Preprocessing: Image scaling, augmentation, and split into training, validation, and test sets.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.
Tools and Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras
Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
